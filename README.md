# Three.js Model Mouse Tracker

## About

* Project loads model from `model/model.json`
* Places it in the center of the screen
* Follows cursor with slight delay

## Usage

* Run with `webpack-dev-server` if you're developing locally
* Run with `webpack` if you want to export `dist/bundle.js` that can be imported in other projects (they need a div with id 'webgl' for the js to target)
